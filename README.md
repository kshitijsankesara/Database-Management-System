# Database-Management-System
For our IST 659 course, we designed and build a Database for a Courier Delivery organization. We have build the database for Status tracking, Route chosen, and Pricing information. Our main aim is to increase automation and reduce all the manual efforts for maintaining the data.

We have developed features like:
1. Automatic Price Calculation
2. Self-Tracking of Parcel
3. Total distance calculation
4. Records for three different delivery types
5. The route will be chosen automatically depending on different factors
6. All information regarding parcel can be accessed by end-users

We started by designing the Entity-Relationship Model and we assigned a relationship to all the entities. We also developed the business rules and made sure that our data is normalized.

We answered multiple business questions related to the data using SQL Queries like:
1. Tracking status of packages in each month
2. Total revenue made by the company in each year
3. City wise revenue made by the company
4. The traffic of each route and zipcode
5. The workload of each warehouse

We build Data Reports and Forms using MS Access and implemented functions like Trigger and Procedure using SQL.Â 

**Tools Used:** SQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Microsoft Visio
